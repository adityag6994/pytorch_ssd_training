May 11 :
Add custom dataset to the pipeline  [x]

May 12 :
Run on COCO first [True]
Then, run on custom dataset [x]
    - mean, normalisation really important, predictions changed drastically when using mean/std values from
     ImageNet (worked best), Dummy Dataset (one false negative), w/o normalised (one false positive)
    - both mean subtraction and dividing by std is required, just doing mean subtraction doesn't give
     good result

     07:54 pm : understood convolutions, normalisation thing, ran inference on custom input

May 13 :
Run on custom dataset [True]
    09:57 am : started with Rafeeq dataset, for detection on SSD
    12:12 pm : created initial json files, starting with initial training
    12:30 pm : completed initial training, with no-pt weights
        - issue with label file, re-training initial model [15:06]
        - add multi gpu support [x]
        - evaluate on pre-trained weights [classes are different issue] [x]
        - play with normalisation [rafeeq dataset specific] [x]

May 14 :
        - add multi gpu support [x]
        - evaluate on pre-trained weights [classes are different issue]
        - play with normalisation [rafeeq dataset specific]
            - problem with pytorch way calculation bcz data already norm [10:40 am]
            - since there are two ways to calculate mean/std, calculate with both and compare [came out same]
            - training started with re-size rafeeq weights [11:19 am]
            - there are always more experiments, you should know when to stop
            - rafeeq values gave better resutls
        - Start with model pruning [15:47 pm]


May 15 :

Quantize/model pruning model (which will require re-training)
Convert it into TensorRT
Try it on Raspberry-Pi


May 17 :
      - experimented with mean/std of test_hard (not possible in real time), didn't imrpvoe much

May 18 - 24 :
      - tried adding jit support for ssd
      - re-trained model by putting ReLU in model deination in __init__, instead of __forward__
      - since, last layer is giving output in tuple(tensor of bbox and classes), it's getting stuck in jit.save/jit. step

May 24 :
      - possible things to explore:
        - complete scripting thing (on hold)
        - compare with yolov3

May 25 :
    - complete detect.py (yolov3)
    - nms difference (soft nms), verify if nms is same
    - study what architectural changes are made in yolov3/yolov3-spp/yolov3-tiny
    - add the visualisationt thing
