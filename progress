May 11 :
Add custom dataset to the pipeline  [x]

May 12 :
Run on COCO first [True]
Then, run on custom dataset [x]
    - mean, normalisation really important, predictions changed drastically when using mean/std values from
     ImageNet (worked best), Dummy Dataset (one false negative), w/o normalised (one false positive)
    - both mean subtraction and dividing by std is required, just doing mean subtraction doesn't give
     good result

     07:54 pm : understood convolutions, normalisation thing, ran inference on custom input

May 13 :
Run on custom dataset
    09:57 am : started with Rafeeq dataset, for detection on SSD
    12:12 am : created initial json files, starting with initial training
        - evaluate on pre-trained weights
        - play with normalisation
Convert it into TensorRT

May 14 :
Quantize model (which will require re-training)

May 15 :
Try it on Raspberry-Pi
